# HRMS-Checker-2.0

The script does the following:

1) locate all PDFs within a given folder
2) locate and extract all accurate mass data from each PDF
3) for each measurement, recalculate the exact mass of the measured ion 
4) calculate deviations of measured, calculated and recalcu-lated masses (in ppm)
5) print a one-line analysis of each measurement highlighting unusual deviations
6) in cases of internal inconsistencies, provide a plausible ex-planation or, if possible, a solution to the problem
7) create a summary for all files investigated
